Here’s a short summary of the steps below without all the explanatory text and screenshots. After you’ve read the detailed instructions, consider this a refresher for future use. Or if it really is too long and you didn’t read it…

1. Navigate to the _posts folder.
2. Create a new file for your post. Name it like YYYY-MM-DD-short-name.md.
3. Add the YAML front matter at the top of the post file. ‘layout’ and ‘title’ are commonly required default fields.
4. Add your post content using Markdown syntax, either in full or as a compelling preview.
5. Commit the file, creating a branch and pull request in the process.
6. Merge the branch after you’ve gotten some feedback from your peers.
